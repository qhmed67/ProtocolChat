# üöÄ ProtocolChat - Device Discovery Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Missing WiFi Permissions** ‚úÖ
- **Added**: `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` permission
- **Added**: `CHANGE_WIFI_STATE` permission  
- **Result**: No more "MISSING_PERMISSION_ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" errors

### 2. **Enhanced Logging** ‚úÖ
- **Added**: Detailed service ID logging
- **Added**: Advertising/discovery status logging
- **Result**: Better debugging for device discovery

## üîß **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Install on Both Devices**
```bash
# Install the updated APK on both devices
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### **Step 2: Grant All Permissions**
On **both devices**, ensure these permissions are granted:
- ‚úÖ **Bluetooth** (automatic on first launch)
- ‚úÖ **Location** (automatic on first launch)  
- ‚úÖ **WiFi State** (new - should be automatic)

### **Step 3: Test Device Discovery**

#### **Device A (e.g., Phone):**
1. Open ProtocolChat
2. Grant all permissions when prompted
3. Enter username: "Alice"
4. Wait for "Scanning for devices..." message
5. Check logs for: `"Advertising started successfully for: Alice"`

#### **Device B (e.g., Tablet):**
1. Open ProtocolChat  
2. Grant all permissions when prompted
3. Enter username: "Bob"
4. Wait for "Scanning for devices..." message
5. Check logs for: `"Advertising started successfully for: Bob"`

### **Step 4: Verify Discovery**

#### **Expected Log Output:**
```
D/NearbyConnectionsManager: Starting advertising with name: Alice and service ID: com.example.nativenonetapp.chat
D/NearbyConnectionsManager: Advertising started successfully for: Alice
D/NearbyConnectionsManager: Starting discovery with service ID: com.example.nativenonetapp.chat
D/NearbyConnectionsManager: Discovery started successfully
```

#### **Expected UI Behavior:**
- Both devices should show "Scanning for devices..."
- After 10-30 seconds, devices should appear in each other's lists
- Device A should see "Bob" in the list
- Device B should see "Alice" in the list

### **Step 5: Test Connection**
1. On either device, tap "Connect" next to the discovered device
2. Wait for connection confirmation
3. Tap "Chat" to open the chat screen
4. Send test messages between devices

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Devices Still Don't Find Each Other:**

#### **Check 1: Permissions**
```bash
# Check if all permissions are granted
adb shell dumpsys package com.example.nativenonetapp | grep permission
```

#### **Check 2: Logs**
```bash
# Monitor logs for discovery issues
adb logcat | grep -E "(NearbyConnectionsManager|NearbyConnections)"
```

#### **Check 3: Service ID Match**
Both devices must use the same service ID: `com.example.nativenonetapp.chat`

#### **Check 4: Physical Distance**
- Keep devices within **3-5 meters** of each other
- Ensure no physical barriers (walls, metal objects)
- Try moving devices closer together

#### **Check 5: Bluetooth & WiFi**
- Ensure Bluetooth is **enabled** on both devices
- Ensure WiFi is **enabled** on both devices (even if not connected to internet)
- Try turning Bluetooth/WiFi off and on again

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **Issue**: "Failed to start discovery"
**Solution**: Check WiFi permissions are granted

#### **Issue**: "No devices found"
**Solution**: 
1. Wait longer (up to 60 seconds)
2. Move devices closer
3. Restart both apps
4. Check both devices are advertising and scanning

#### **Issue**: "Connection failed"
**Solution**:
1. Ensure both devices are on the same network (WiFi)
2. Try restarting the connection process
3. Check device logs for specific error messages

## üì± **Expected Behavior**

### **Successful Discovery:**
- ‚úÖ Both devices show "Scanning for devices..."
- ‚úÖ After 10-30 seconds, devices appear in each other's lists
- ‚úÖ Tap "Connect" establishes connection
- ‚úÖ Tap "Chat" opens chat screen
- ‚úÖ Messages can be sent between devices

### **Log Indicators of Success:**
```
D/NearbyConnectionsManager: Advertising started successfully for: [username]
D/NearbyConnectionsManager: Discovery started successfully
D/NearbyConnectionsManager: Endpoint found: [endpointId], name: [username]
```

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

The app is working correctly when:
1. ‚úÖ No permission errors in logs
2. ‚úÖ Both devices start advertising successfully  
3. ‚úÖ Both devices start discovery successfully
4. ‚úÖ Devices appear in each other's discovery lists
5. ‚úÖ Connection can be established
6. ‚úÖ Chat messages can be sent between devices
